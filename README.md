# Implementations

This repo contains my C++ implementations of STL containers like `vector`, `stack`, `queue`, etc.

I'm focusing only on the most basic and core functionalities to understand how they work internally.

## Functionalities covered

- Initialization
- Push / Pop operations
- Accessing elements
- Checking size and capacity
- Basic memory handling (for dynamic containers)

More containers will be added step by step.
